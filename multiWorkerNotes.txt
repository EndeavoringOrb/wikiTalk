# Connecting new client:
1. new client connects to server
2. server requests current weights from one of the current clients
3. new client sends how many threads it has
4. server sends current weights to new client
5. server sends a test to the new client
6. new client sends test results
7. server assigns a nTrials for that client based on the test

# Training:

for each client:
    send(done, weight_request, seeds, nTrials[clientID])

each client does their trials

for each client:
    recv(R)
    nTrialsFinished[clientID] = len(R)

calculate A

for each client:
    send(A, nTrialsFinished)
